## Lead (sales lead):
A sales lead is a potential sales contact, an individual or organization that expresses an interest in your goods or services. Leads are typically obtained through the referral of an existing customer, or through a direct response to advertising or publicity. A company's marketing department is typically responsible for lead generation.
